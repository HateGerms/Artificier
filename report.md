I hope this email finds you well.

Now that the sales week has started, I can confirm that breaks have been managed optimally, and there have been no significant issues with staff during.

In terms of product performance, boxers, t-shirts, and multibuy are doing quite well. However, we are beginning to experience shortages in chinos and shorts, with limited sizes available. This is becoming a noticeable challenge as we still have many customers looking for shorts, likely in preparation for vacations.

Regarding CRM for July, the book outreach has been conducted, and I am in the process of showing Ian how to perform the manual outreach. For now, we are waiting for the right moment to proceed. That said, we are still facing some issues with Emmanuelâ€™s code, and I am awaiting a response from the CRM team.

On the floor, there have been no major problems. Every day that I was working, we achieved a good conversion rate and ensured that all areas were covered, even when we were short on staff.

As for the online WhatsApp, there have been no particular requests, and everything has gone smoothly.

Lastly, over the past two weeks, we ensured that the restocking of drawers was carried out on time, with no significant issues arising in the process.

Please let me know if you need further details or clarification.

Best regards,
